# Galoppen
Code for a galoppen game based of of a carnival game from Tivoli Gardens.
Basically just using github to transfer files between computers.
Feel free to use this if you happen to stumble upon it

Ok so I really havent been updating this readme.

### Hardware specs:

Using a raspi 3+ and a teensyduino 4.1.

(using a different sensor now i cant remember what it is and ill look it up later)

Also using an, "Anmbest AMS1117-3...4.75V-12V to 3.3V 800mA", to step down the 5 volts outputed by the teensy to 3.3.

(Sorry for the weird names, just reading them off of the packaging.)

Teensyduino controls i/o for ir prox sensors and leds.
Raspi receives controls via serial and display them as graphics.

### Updates

I'll add a circuit diagram once the basic circuit is moved off of the test breadboard and onto a prototyping breadboard.

(EDIT)
 Made models for the game itself, will post later.
 FYI, the models were made in FreeCAD
